# Book Notes
## Description
A web application that allows me to keep track of all the non-fiction books I have read, my notes about them, my ratings, and the dates in which I read them. This project utilizes the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) for book covers.
